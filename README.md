| TODO | TODO |


# Hardware framework

The project was executed on the following hardware:

| Component | Specifications  |
| --------- | --------------- |
| CPU       | Intel i7 4770   |
| GPU       | NVIDIA GTX 1080 |

# Data download API

The code uses the [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) to download the external input data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).  

A file _kaggle.json_, which contains user API credentials, should be copied to the _.kaggle_ directory, located in the user's _home_ directory.

For more information, see the [Kaggle API documentation](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api).
